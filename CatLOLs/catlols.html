            <p>Pop Cat refers to a series of videos in which use two images of a cat named Oatmeal, one with its mouth closed, and the other photoshopped as if the cat is holding it wide open in the shape of an O. The images have been used to create videos in which the cat lip syncs various songs, similar to Baby Eats Camera memes.

The meme template trended mostly on TikTok in 2023, where creators used a greenscreen template to edit the cats over various backgrounds that coincided with the given caption. Also, TikTokers predominantly used the TikTok sound and song "aquatic ambience" by scizzie. The original video was filmed by a Japanese TikToker in March 2023.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>"Kitler" is a nickname used to describe white cats with black markings under their noses that resemble German dictator Adolf Hitler’s toothbrush mustache.[1] Cats with these coats were popularized in June 2006 by the single topic site Cats that Look Like Hitler.

            <p>
              In May 2006, Dutch journalist Koos Plegt set up a blog to showcase photos of cats with black fur under their noses, resembling Adolf Hitler's famous moustache after seeing a cat with this coat pattern in his hometown of Zwolle, Holland. A month after the site's inception, Plegt was contacted by British web developer Paul Neve about turning the blog into a collaborative website. Cats That Look Like Hitler was launched on June 26th, 2006. Users can rate and comment on the cat photos as well as submit their own.

            <p>
              Plegt's original blog was linked on the Geek Culture Forums, MetaFilter, I Am Bored and Fresh Pics as well as personal blogs like Dvorak and Kitten Fluff. After the domain had been set up, the new link was shared on art blog Meathaus, StumbleUpon and web culture blog The Churning. In January 2007, PopMatters linked to the blog as well. "Kitler" was first defined on Urban Dictionary on July 20th, 2006.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2009, Cats That Look Like Hitler was featured on the BBC talk show The Graham Norton Show, during which Norton browsed through the site with his guests and showcased some of his favorite cats. The site hit American television in July 2010 with a mention on The Colbert Report followed by a CNN segment broadcasted the next day.

              in the 2010 movie, The Social Network, in a scene that takes place in 2004, a girl gets an email about Zuckerberg's new site. When she initially sees the message alert, she tells her friend she hopes its another website of pictures of cat's that look like Hitler. IMDB even considered this a possible movie mistake, but pointed out that cats that look like Hitler was an existing concept before the site came out in 2006.
